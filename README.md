Simple browser test for HTML5 file upload
-----------------------------------------

Tests two methods of AJAX file upload using HTML5 drag and drop. The first passes a `File` object as the XHR data, the second constructs a `FormData` object and adds the file to it.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies, then run `npm start` to start the server. Edit `server.js` and change the port number if you get a port conflict.

Point your browser at http://localhost:8080/upload.html.
